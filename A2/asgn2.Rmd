## Assignment 2

**Name:** Rhyme Bulbul

**Student ID:** 31865224

**AI Statement:** Generative AI was not used in this assignment.

<!-- - The main body of this report is almost 15 pages. This length is due to some long code blocks and the sizes of the decision tree diagram and ROC curve plots that have to be big to make them readable. All other pages are the Appendix, which include repeated code and outputs. -->
<!-- - Due to length, from Question 9 onwards, similar code from Questions 4 and 5 used to make predictions, create confusion matrices, report accuracies, construct ROC curves and compute AUC values will not be shown in the main report but in the Appendix. ROC curve plots will also not be shown in the main report except that of Question 12, which shows the curves for all classifiers. -->

<!-- My unique dataset of 2000 rows is first created with the following code from the specifications. Libraries needed to perform the tasks are imported as well. -->

```{r message = FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
Phish <- read.csv("PhishingData.csv")
set.seed(31865224)
L <- as.data.frame(c(1:50))
L <- L[sample(nrow(L), 10, replace = FALSE),]
Phish <- Phish[(Phish$A01 %in% L),]
PD <- Phish[sample(nrow(Phish), 2000, replace = FALSE),]
