Trivia

Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, 13-year-old Connor McGrath, a terminally ill fan from Edmonton, requested to attend the special event for Deadpool (2016) in January, which turned out to be one of the two special screenings in New York and Los Angeles for the fans. He couldn't make it, due to the severity of his illness. Ryan Reynolds heard his story, traveled to Edmonton, and surprised him with a private special screening of the film. Reynolds said the boy was the first person ever to see the film. They kept in touch until Connor's passing a few months later. Reynolds paid tribute to him on his social media pages.
Goofs
(at around 40 mins) In an early scene in which Deadpool escapes from Colossus, he has neither sword on his back as he falls into an open-bed truck. He later emerges from the truck and now has both swords in place. Then after another flashback, the swords are gone again.
Quotes
Deadpool: From the studio that inexplicably sewed his fucking mouth shut the first time comes five-time Academy Award viewer, Ryan Reynolds in an eHarmony date with destiny. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... me! Deadpool.

Crazy credits

The opening credits are placeholders for what was in the script. "As written by Deadpool"; "Some douchebag's film, Starring God's perfect idiot (referring to Ryan. Accompanied by an Easter Egg of Ryan's People Magazine cover as Sexiest Man Alive); "A hot chick"; "A British villain"; "The comic relief"; "A moody teen"; "A CGI character"; "A gratuitous cameo"; "Produced by asshats"; "Written by the real heroes here"; "Directed by an overpaid tool". There are Easter Eggs as well: The card in the wallet of Ryan in a green suit, the thug with the lighter was originally a filmed joke in reference to Colin Farrell in Daredevil (2003), "Rob L." on the coffee cup is Rob Liefeld, the little sex key-chain, the Orange Number 5 card, and the Hello Kitty.
Alternate versions

The theatrical and DVD releases were censored by the CBFC in India to secure an A rating (restricted to adults i.e. 18+):
'Asshole', 'motherfucker', 'balls', 'blowjob', 'touching myself', '24 ball gags', 'vagina', 'bitch', 'dick', 'suck a cock', 'testicles' and 'dildo' were all muted.
The triple head-shot in the highway fight was removed.
Nudity, thrusting and innuendos were removed from the sex scene.
Deadpool cutting his hand off was removed and replaced with shots of Colossus.
A poster showing a woman touching her vagina was removed.
Shots of naked women in the strip club were removed.
Blood and gore in the final fight was removed.
Anti-smoking disclaimers and a health spot were added to the beginning and middle of the film. Static, scrolling messages were also added whenever a character is shown smoking.
The general censorship of violence/sex/swearing totaled 3 minutes and 53 seconds. The visual cuts were replaced with zoomed in versions of the same sequences and hence there is no change in the duration of the movie except for an anti-smoking PSA added voluntary that added exactly 2 minutes to the movie, changing the total duration to a 110 minutes and 47 seconds, as per the CBFC's list of edits. The Indian Blu-ray release is uncut (despite also showing an A certificate on the back cover).

This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks

Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.

Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.

From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.
