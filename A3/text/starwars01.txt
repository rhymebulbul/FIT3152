Trivia
George Lucas was so sure this movie would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on vacation to Hawaii with his good friend Steven Spielberg. It was on that vacation that they came up with the idea for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).
Goofs
When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy "donk" sound effect.
Quotes

[Han answers the intercom after comandeering an attack station]

Han Solo: [1:15:22] Uh, everything's under control. Situation normal.

Voice: What happened?

Han Solo: [getting nervous] Uh, we had a slight weapons malfunction, but uh... everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. How are you?

Voice: We're sending a squad up.

Han Solo: Uh, uh... negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak, very dangerous.

Voice: Who is this? What's your operating number?

Han Solo: Uh...

[Han shoots the intercom]

Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY!

Crazy credits
The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits.
Alternate versions
In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can be seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III.

FEATURED REVIEW
10
/10
A film that changed the industry forever.

The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.

I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said, instead I'll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.

Consider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.

This film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today's mediocre offerings.

You have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.

It's funny, entertaining, exciting, jaw dropping, moving, it's everything you want from a movie, years on, it's still a masterpiece.

10/10.
