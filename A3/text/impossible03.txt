Trivia
As the production could do nothing about inquisitive crowds watching them while they were filming in Rome, they actually set up a phony second unit a little further away, hired several girls in bikinis and several older women dressed as nuns and pretended to be filming takes for the film, while the main unit got on with their business largely undisturbed.
Goofs
(at around 1h 22 mins) Luther states Ethan is going to use a "fulcrum" to swing from one building to another in order to steal the Rabbit's Foot when in fact what the team uses is a pendulum. A fulcrum is a point for a lever to act upon, a pendulum swings under the influence of gravity.
Quotes
Ethan Hunt: I'm part of an agency... called the IMF.

Julia: What's that stand for?

Ethan Hunt: Impossible Mission Force.

Julia: [chuckles] Shut up.

FEATURED REVIEW
The Best So Far

Mission: Impossible 3 (2006)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt and this time he's battling a sadistic arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman). This is without question the best in the series and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the previous two films. I thought the first film was way too confusing for its own good while the second one was way too much action and not enough brains. This third film hits on all the right notes and delivers some terrific action scenes mixed with a pretty smart script that doesn't go over the top on brains. The real key to the film is the terrific performance by Hoffman. He's been known for years as a great character actor but when I heard he was playing the villain I honestly didn't think he could pull it off but he comes off quite menacing in the role. He doesn't have any funny lines, which is a great thing because it makes him all the more threatening. Then there's Cruise who delivers another all-star performance. I think, in real life, Cruise is a jackass but he still manages to be the greatest movie star out there. The supporting cast including Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne all do fine work as well. The action scenes are also some of the best I've seen including the wonderful attack on the bridge.
