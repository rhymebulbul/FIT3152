Goofs
(at around 1h 3 mins) This film shows the compass being given to Jack by a captain he worked for in his youth as that captain is dying. In Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), Tia Dalma said he bartered the compass from her.
Quotes

Captain Jack Sparrow: Who are you?

Henry: My name is Henry Turner. Son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann.

Captain Jack Sparrow: Ewww. You're the evil spawn of them two.

[pause]

Captain Jack Sparrow: Does mummy ever ask about me?

Henry: No.

Captain Jack Sparrow: Oh go on. She call my name in her sleep?

Henry: She never spoke of you.

Captain Jack Sparrow: Are you sure we're talking about the same people? He's a cursed eunuch. She's golden-haired, stubborn, pouty lips, neck like a giraffe, and two of those wonderful...

Henry: Yes! Yes, it's her.

Crazy credits
There is a scene at the end of the closing credits: Will wakes up from a vision involving Davy Jones. He assumes this is a nightmare and returns to sleep, but is unaware to a few of Jones' tokens remaining.
Alternate versions
The film's IMAX release presented the film open-matte, at an aspect ratio of 1.90:1, meaning there was more picture information visible in the top and bottom of the frame (more picture is opened up at the bottom of the frame due to the common-top method used, resulting in the 2.39 image space appearing at the top) than in normal theaters and on home video.

FEATURED REVIEW
a retread of its origins
Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **
