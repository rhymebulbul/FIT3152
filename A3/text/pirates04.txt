Storyline
Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) crosses paths with a woman from his past, Angelica (Penélope Cruz), and he's not sure if it's love, or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.—ahmetkozan

Trivia
While filming in London in October 2010, Johnny Depp received a letter from a local nine-year old schoolgirl, telling him her classmates needed help to "mutiny" against her teachers. He turned up with almost no warning at the school in full Captain Jack Sparrow outfit, but advised against mutiny.
Goofs
(at around 27 mins) Jack and Angelica jump into the Thames to escape King George's soldiers, and are shown swimming in clear water. The River Thames of the 1740s was a slurry of waste and a fall into the water could - and often did - kill.
Quotes
Jack Sparrow: You know the feeling you get when standing in a high place, the sudden urge to jump...

[looks over the cliff, as if considering jumping, then comes back to reality]

Jack Sparrow: I don't have it.

Crazy credits
There is a scene at the end of the closing credits: Angelica acquires Jack Sparrow's voodoo doll.
Alternate versions
There are three versions available. Runtimes are "2h 17m (137 min), 2h 16m (136 min) (United States)" and "2h 17m (137 min) (Argentina)".

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is another enjoyable romp with Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz
I had previously enjoyed the first and third of the Johnny Depp pirate movies though I was confused by some of the sequences. This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There's also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended.
