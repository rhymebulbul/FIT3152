Storyline
Did you know
Trivia
(at around 2h) The scene when Jack Sparrow calls Davy Jones "fish face", and sings to them "I got a jar of dirt", was unscripted and improvised by Johnny Depp, most of the reactions of the rest of the characters are real.
Goofs
Monkey Jack was cured from the curse of immortality together with the rest of the crew at the climax of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). However, in the post-credits scene of that movie, the monkey takes a coin, therefore making himself immortal again for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006).
Quotes
Elizabeth Swann: There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing.

Jack Sparrow: I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.

Crazy credits
There is a scene at the end of the closing credits: the prison dog is seen to be the new king of the Pelegosto natives.

FEATURED REVIEW

Better than the first, and that's saying something

I will firstly say that after seeing the trailer and previews for this film I had serious doubts. I was afraid that the producers would just try to cash in on the original's success, and forget about any content.

I was pleasantly proved wrong.

This is the most fun I've had in the cinema in the longest time. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained.

Although it is a bit slow at times, and a bit predictable (although fun in it's predictability), it hardly lets up and continuously entertains.

If you loved the original, you will DEFINITELY love this film. The ending not only makes you laugh, it makes you think "What the hell?" and will make you eagerly anticipate (major understatement) the third installment.

There are some great lines, the same fun characters, an inventive and fun story, and some brilliantly staged action sequences.

In summation: SEE IT! See it on the big screen. If you miss it, you will surely regret it.
