Storyline
Since Dom (Diesel) and Brian's (Walker) Rio heist toppled a kingpin's empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe. But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again.â€”ahmetkozan

Trivia
When Hobbs arrives at the barbecue, Roman remarks that they "better hide the baby oil," to which Hobbs replies with "you better hide that big-ass forehead." Hobbs' line was improvised by Dwayne Johnson, so Ludacris spitting out his drink and Tyrese Gibson being at a loss for words are both spontaneous, genuine reactions.
Goofs

The longest paved runway in Spain (where the scene takes place) is at Madrid's Torrejon airport, at ~4,800 meters, or about three miles. The heroes chase the villains down the runway (apparently unaware of where they are) for about a minute before the plane appears, thus eating up at least one third of the runway's length. The plane, an Antonov AN-124, plans to do a touch-and-go - a landing and immediate take off, once the villains are aboard. While this is certainly possible in the last two miles of runway, such a maneuver should take approximately one minute. Any longer at over 100 MPH, and there wouldn't be any more runway to fly over. The length of the scene is far beyond anything even remotely possible under the circumstances.
Quotes
Roman: This is crazy. We are not in Brazil. So we got cars flyin' in the air, on some 007 type shit? This is not what we do!

Tej Parker: Man you really gotta check that emotion. Your voice just went from Shaggy to Scooby Doo. This is not what we doooo roo roo!

Crazy credits

After the character credits following the film, we're shown Han's final race from The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). However, we start seeing angles of it from inside a car, where a gloved hand is adjusting switches and preparing to move. As in _Tokyo Drift_, a Mercedes slams into Han's car, but it doesn't kill him outright. The driver of the Mercedes, an unnamed character played by Jason Statham, emerges from his car; he then pulls the 'cross necklace' (seen earlier in the film and also the one from Fast Five and Four) from his pocket and throws it into the fuel spill/the direction of Han's car. Han's car then explodes from the fuel leak and subsequent engine fire. Jason Statham's character then makes a call, saying, "Dominic Toretto. You don't know me. You're about to."
Alternate versions

The Extended version runs ~1min longer (13 extended scenes, 9 scenes with alternate material, 2 extended scenes with alternate material):
When Riley and Gisele approach the car manufacturer (Thure Lindhardt), there's a rant by him: "Who sent you? Oh come on, ladies! Two hot girls like you don't wander into this neighborhood unless I've called the escort service. And I haven't, yet, today."
At the end of the subway station fight between Letty and Riley, Letty strangles Riley with the handcuffs and pushes her back against the wall. She recognizes the train is about the leave then kicks her in the back of the knee before running off to the train.
There's an additional short exchange between Dominic and Han about the new 4-speed Camaro SS before Roman's hook hits the wall.

FEATURED REVIEW

/10
12 years after the first outing and the franchise is unrecognisable - which is a good thing

The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.

The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.

With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.

The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.

London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.

For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme â€“ and always affable â€“ introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.

For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.

The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.

Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.

Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that followsÂ…
