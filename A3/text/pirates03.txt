Storyline
After losing Jack Sparrow to the locker of Davy Jones, the team of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Barbossa make their final alliances with the pirate world to take on the forces of Lord Cutler Beckett and his crew, including Davy Jones, who he now has control over. It's not going to be easy, as they must rescue Sparrow, convince all the pirate lords to join them and defeats Beckett, whilst each individual pirate has their own route which they wish to follow.—Film_Fan

Trivia
The most expensive film ever made (at the time), not adjusted for inflation. The budget ran to $300 million. That's more than the budget of all three Lord of the Rings films combined.
Goofs
(at around 10 mins) It's often believed that the founding and naming of Singapore postdate the period in which the films are set. In fact, the name "Singapura" - "city of the lions" - was first given in the fourteenth century.
Quotes
Captain Ammand: [about Barbossa] Shoot him!

Captain Jocard: Cut out his tongue!

Jack Sparrow: Shoot him and cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue! And trim that scraggly beard!

Crazy credits
There is a scene at the end of the closing credits: Will returns after serving for ten years aboard the Dutchman, and reunites with Elizabeth and their son.
Alternate versions
There are two versions available, the worldwide theatrical release, and an one edited for the People's Republic of China. Runtimes are, respectively, "2h 49m (169 min)" and "2h 8m (128 min) (Mainland China Censored Version) (China)".

FEATURED REVIEW
Pirates 3: Not a Disaster at All

The third installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is not, as popularly believed, disastrous or incredibly confusing. At the very start of the movie I was hooked again.

The movie contains a lot of information to process, but if you actually sit down and follow it you'll find it is not confusing at all. As the third and hopefully not last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I believe they did an excellent job. Although the movies have become more serious they are still funny and a lot of fun to watch.

Not only did this movie create another cliffhanger ending that leaves us wondering if there will be more but it also immortalized characters such as the famous Jack Sparrow.

I personally think that the second movie was not as bad as people said it was, it was also quite good. The third was definitely better, and allowed you to see the characters in a much different way.

So stop believing people when they say this movie wasn't good at all, it was excellent!
