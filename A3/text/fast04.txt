Storyline
Former cop Brian O'Conner partners with ex-con Dom Toretto on the opposite side of the law. Since Brian and Mia Toretto broke Dom out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail. Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs never misses his target. When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an all-out assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil, Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now, he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey... before someone else runs them down first.â€”Universal Pictures

Trivia
The stunt involving the flatbed truck slamming into the moving train was filmed practically, without the use of miniatures or CGI. The collision nearly derailed the train, as can clearly be seen.
Goofs
Dom and Brian were dragging the vault out of the Police Station behind their cars, on their first turn to right, the vault rolled over three or four times hence causing the attached strings to entangle. However in the next scene the strings were not entangled but straightly connected to the cars. The same mistake was made repeatedly during the pursuit.
Quotes
Tej: Aw, hell no. They really went and scraped the bottom of the barrel here, didn't they?

Roman Pearce: Guess they did, considering your ass is here. When are you gonna give Martin Luther King his car back?

Tej: As soon as you give Rick James his jacket back.

Crazy credits
SPOILER: After the credits roll, Agent Fuentes (Eva Mendes) comes in with a file to Hobbs' office. He asks if the file contains news on Dom and says he is not interested when she says it doesn't. She informs him he should be very interested, and asks if he believes in ghosts as she shows him a picture of Letty, alive.
Alternate versions

The extended cut is a minute longer with slight more graphic violence with the following additions:
After Hobbs' team shootout with Zizi's gang, he asks whether all is clear while they are aiming guns at Neves.
Tej admits that the safe they're going after is the hardest to crack and they need another duplicate safe to practice.
The crew talks about breaking into the safe and how to transport the money. Brian founds out that there's an adjoining wall to the toilet room. Roman and Han, tasked to transport the money says of a possible solution : a ventilation shaft that leads straight into the garage so they can transport the money from the shaft into the transport cars.
Hobbs' and Dominic's brawl is slightly longer: Hobbs lands a cracking elbow check on Dom's back and Dom punches Hobbs in the ribs. Then another hard headbutt and a punch at Hobbs' face. When Hobbs hit back, there's another punch at Dom before Hobbs spins around for another lunge. Finally, when Hobbs is down on the floor, there's another punch from Dom.
When rescuing Hobbs' team who are being ambushed by Reyes's men, Dominic fires two more shots at Reyes's men while Hobb's is still lying on the ground
Instead of a black screen, the start of the end credits has a warning on stunts shouldn't be imitated at home.

FEATURED REVIEW

Definitely the best Action flick in the series from 2011

Fast Five (2011) is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments.

The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.

Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.

Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million!

"Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!"

I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.

When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.
