Task 2: Focus country vs all other countries as a group
2(a)
I will be analyzing Croatia in this assignment. We will start by creating bar charts for each group of
countries, where the y-axis represents the survey questions, and the x-axis represents the mean of each
questions’ response. Below, we will create data frames for the mean values utilizing ggplot2, excluding
non-numerical attributes such as coded_country.
croatia <- cvbase[cvbase$coded_country == "Croatia", ]
others <- anti_join(cvbase, croatia)
numeric_cols <- sapply(croatia, is.numeric)
means <- colMeans(croatia[, numeric_cols], na.rm = TRUE)
croatia_means <- data.frame(mean = means)
numeric_cols <- sapply(others, is.numeric)
2others_means <- colMeans(others[, numeric_cols], na.rm = TRUE)
others_means <- data.frame(mean = others_means)
croatia_plotted <- ggplot(croatia_means) +
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = rownames(croatia_means), y = mean), stat = "identity",
fill = "purple") +

Mean of responses
Looking at both graphs of Croatia, and all other countries in comparison, most responses seem to be quite
similar, except for Boredom, bor01,bor02 and bor03. While the worldwide mean is between 0 (Neither
agree nor disagree) and 1 (Somewhat agree), in Croatia, the mean is negative and closer to 1 (Somewhat
disagree). This leads us to believe people in Croatia could be less bored than other countries worldwide,
albeit slightly. Additionally, there seems to be no Corona Proximity for participants themselves, as well as
members of their family in this dataset.
2(b)
Let’s start by taking a peek through the correlation of each predictor for pro-social attitude in Croatia. We
can visualise the correlation matrix through a heatmap using cor(). While Croatia has a lower response
rate than other highly populated countries, some operations might not have sufficient data to action.

Tiles that are red or blue denote positive or negative correlation, respectively, and turn white as correlation
gets closer to zero. Numerous examples of substantial association between predictors can be seen in this
heatmap; nevertheless, the portion displaying the correlation between pro-social views and all other traits is
5quite weak. This suggests that the characteristics might not be a very good indicator of pro-social sentiments
in Croatia.
It is possible to determine how survey replies predict the pro-social attitude question through a linear
regression model, fitted for each pro-social attitude based on the qualities. Once fitted, it is possible to find
the most accurate predictions.
A linear model of each pro-social attitude versus the qualities is fitted by the code that follows. Each model’s
R-squared, significant predictors possessing a confidence level greater than 99.9%, summarising corresponding
coefficients using a function and a for loop. The vectors predictors and each_model will be utilised in a
subsequent table to compare the strong predictors for every model.

C19ProSo03 has the greatest adjusted R-squared at 0.278256 out of all the models, indicating that the
responses best predict it. isoFriends_online is its best predictor. The C19ProSo04 model has the least
adjusted R-squared value at 0.1016124 , and rankOrdLife_4D is its best predictor.
The fact that the majority of the survey items are deemed subjective makes the models’ arguably low R-
squared values predictable. For instance, different individuals interpret financial hardship differently and
perceive various levels of serenity differently. Since Croatia is a moderately populated nation with a wide
range of living standards, its several regions are like independent nations with their own economies, healthcare
systems, and general levels of satisfaction. Because of this, it is challenging to forecast the pro-social attitude
reactions with consistency.
Although each model has a unique set of important predictors, some predictors can be regarded as generally
more reliable because they are more frequently found in all of the models. Given the smaller size of the Croatia
dataset, it is harder to find a highly predictive variable for each of the models other than isoFriends_online.
During a pandemic, someone who has constant social interactions, whether in person, or at the very least
online but outside of their household, would be expected to undestand and related to the nature of such a
pandemic and it’s effects. Conversely, a person devoid of pro-social attitudes would not care about adhering
to new rules or showing any interest in societal behaviors. Those who disagree with social distancing policies
and believe that doing so benefits society as a whole may also have an impact on the predictive power of
variables. During the epidemic, lock down protests were prevalent in Croatia, demonstrating the validity of
this viewpoint.
rankOrdLife_4D is an additional variable that predicts the models effectively. People are more likely to be
7pro-social if they care about the future of society, if they have a purpose in life, and if they think society can
come to an agreement on how to handle the pandemic.
2(c)
The previous code blocks for 2(b) are modified, but with the others data set instead of croatia, to produce
a similar correlation matrix for the rest of the world. To keep the report concise, variants of code that have
been modified further on, can be found in the Appendix.

When we compare the two heatmaps we currently have, we see that croatia_correlation_plotted has
tiles coloured in a deeper shade of red, which suggests a larger overall correlation between the predictors.
8Apart from having lighter tiles, global_correlation_plotted appears “cleaner” due to a reduced disper-
sion of coloured tiles. However, since the subsections in both plots appear fairly similar, focusing on the
heatmap subsections that illustrate the association between pro-social attitudes and all other features, We
can hypothesise that pro-social views should be predicted with somewhat equivalent performance by the
attributes for both sets of data.

All four models had adjusted R-squared somewhere between 0.12 and 0.17, pointing to a smaller range than
the comparable one for the Croatia data set (0.06 - 0.49), according to the summary for the rest of the
world. The models’ predictors are significantly more important than those of the croatia models. The four
models are well predicted by employstatus, isoFriends_online, lifeSat, MLQ, bor, consp, rankOrdLife,
c19perBeh, c19RCAcoronaClose and edu. The majority of the predictors that performed well in all four of
the croatia models, isoFriends_online and rankOrdLife are included in this set. As was already said,
Croatia’s sheer vastness and diversity make it seem like a collection of independent nations. It follows that
strong predictors for Croatia would also apply to other nations collectively.
The table below displays the results of the strongest predictors for each pro-social behaviour for Croatia and
the rest of the globe.

RoW_C19ProSo04Task 3: Focus country vs cluster of similar countries
3(a)
Some additional data is collected from external sources to supplement the indicators available in the sources
mentioned in the references. Eight indicators make up the final data table compiled (in Appendix )
for use in clustering: HDI, GHS, freedom, political_stability, happiness, total_vax_per_hundred,
total_cases_per_mil, and total_deaths_per_mil. The Appendix contains information and explana-
tions regarding each indicator as well as its sources.
Using k-means clustering, nations that are comparable to Croatia are found. For the kmeans() function to
function, countries with NA values must first be eliminated. This has no bearing on our findings because
the majority of these nations—such as Afghanistan and Syria—do not initially appear in the baseline data
and differ greatly from Croatia in terms of development and data transparency. After scaling the data, we
use a few random beginnings to carry out K-means clustering.
external <- read.csv("task3.csv")
cleaned_external <- na.omit(external)
cleaned_external[, 2:9] <- scale(cleaned_external[, 2:9])
kfit <- kmeans(cleaned_external[, 2:9], round(nrow(cleaned_external) / 5), nstart = 15)
clusters <- data.frame(country = cleaned_external[[1]], cluster = kfit$cluster)
target <- filter(clusters, country == "Croatia")$cluster
similar <- filter(clusters, cluster == target)

3(b)
After removing the data from Croatia, the baseline data of the cluster’s member nations are initially extracted
by inner joining cvbase and similar. Finally, we visualize the given correlation matrix, in line with croatia
and the rest of the globe.
colnames(similar)[colnames(similar) == "country"] <- "coded_country"
common <- merge(cvbase, similar, by = "coded_country", all = FALSE)

This heat map’s scatter of colored tiles is identical to the Croatia heat map’s, showing how similar these
two nations are. In comparison to the previous plots, the portion of tiles displaying the correlation between
predictors and pro-social views is generally darker, suggesting the predictors related to the cluster in question
may perform positively in terms of prediction than the data from the previous two groups.
Finally, repeating the code fragments from Task 2, b and c, we can output a structured summary for all
models in order to determine how respondent answers can be a significant predictor of pro-social views
pertaining to the similar countries cluster in question.

Based on the results, the models for these comparable nations typically have adjusted R-squared values
that are comparable to those of Croatia and all other nations combined. Unlike the Croatia models,
C19ProSo04 seems to have the greatest adjusted R-squared value (0.1356944). Except for C19ProSo04,
which has significant predictors including disc02, MLQ, c19NormShould and c19IsPunish, none of these
models, in contrast to the preceding eight models, had significant predictors with p-values less than 0.001.
In the Croatia model, disc02 is also a very good predictor for C19ProSo04, but not for PFS02. However,
disc02, MLQ, c19NormShould and c19IsPunish are all significant predictors over the rest of the globe model
for C19ProSo04.
Consequently, the prediction of qualities for this cluster of countries is in no way particularly better off
than Croatia or the rest of the globe, with comparable R-squared values and predictors with generally lower
confidence intervals. The previously reported large correlation may have been insignificant sample size rather
than representing genuine statistically significant links between pro-social attitudes and qualities.
We can define a strong predictor in relation to a model’s total p-values for comparative purposes. For these
novel cluster models, we characterize a strong predictor as one with a p-value of less than 0.05, which is a
widely accepted threshold. A new visualization table is constructed and the model_evaluated function is
changed in line with the model.

We see that strongest predictors being distributed between the models of countries that are similar is closer
to the Croatian models, with a few shared significant predictors (i.e., appearing quite as “sparse” as the
Croatia models). Given more comparable p-values, the models from the group of all other nations have a
great deal more significant predictors in common with the Croatian models. These models do, however,
also contain a large number of powerful predictors that are absent from the Croatian models. Consequently,
the group of comparable nations may provide a better fit to the critical characteristics needed to predict
pro-social sentiments. The smaller the confidence level, as well as less common strongest predictors included
throughout those models may become insignificant with additional study or a larger sample size.
One explanation could be that, despite their similarities to Croatia, each country in the cluster varies
slightly from the others in terms of socioeconomic factors that are not taken into account by the clustering
indicators.. Their collective performance in forecasting pro-social attitudes differs substantially from Croatia
alone when these small variations are taken into account. However, because Croatia’s politics, culture, and
other aspects of society are complicated, much like those of a group of many countries, its models have many
strong predictors in common with the models pertaining to the cluster of all countries. The models may
report multiple significant predictors that are not important because the cluster of all other countries could
be too complicated or big.
